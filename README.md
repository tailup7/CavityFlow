# Cavity Flow

## overview
Cavity flow is a flow in which a horizontal flow crosses the upper side, for example, a hollow in the bottom of a river.
There is no need to consider inflow and outflow conditions and the region is simple in shape, 
so it is well known as a benchmark problem in fluid analysis.

boundary condition : u = v = 0 at east, west, south wall. <br>
                      u = U, v = 0 at south wall
initial condition : uniformly 0
